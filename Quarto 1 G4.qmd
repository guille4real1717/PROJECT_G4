## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1 = 4
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

1. Title of your project (in Yaml header).

2. Names of group members (in Yaml header).

3. Github user name for each group member.

4. A description of the selected data. A link to the data and describe its structure and main variables. (If it is your own data, upload it to github to link it here).

5. Define the objectives, research questions and main hypotheses.

6. Name the analyses you think are necessary or which you would like to use.
